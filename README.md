# My personal configuration files

![screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/kwc46mV)

These are the dotfiles for the programs I use in my Arch Linux system. The
amount of modification varies between the programs. And they are gathered here
mainly to be easier fot me to access them any time I want, without having to
keep them in my system. That being said, I'm quite proud of some configs
(mostly `bspwm`,`nvim`, and `polybar`, although I'm improving
all of them) and hope you, stranger reading this, like them as well.
