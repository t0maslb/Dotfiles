# My personal configuration files

[](img.png)

These are the dotfiles for the programs I use in my Arch Linux system. The
amount of modification varies between the programs. And they are gathered here
mainly to be easier fot me to access them any time I want, without having to
keep them in my system. That being said, I'm quite proud of some configs
(mostly `bspwm`,`nvim`, and `polybar`, although I'm improving
all of them) and hope you, stranger reading this, like them as well.

### Flavours
This configuration has been updated to work with flavours, allowing the user
to change the color themes of all (most) programs at the same time with the same
scheme. *In order for it to work with dmenu, either modify the config to your liking
or compile it from source at `.local/pkg/dmenu`.

To change the config, `Super-z` creates a dmenu prompt with all the colors for you to choose.
