# My personal configuration files

These are the dotfiles for the programs I use in my Arch Linux system. The
amount of modification varies between the programs. And they are gathered here
mainly to be easier fot me to access them any time I want, without having to
keep them in my system. That being said, I'm quite proud of some configs
(mostly ```qtile```,```st```, and ```vim```, although I think I'm improving
all of them) and hope you, stranger reading this, like them as well.

Note that right now (as my .xinitrc would suggest) I'm using bspwm, sxhkd,
and polybar as my wm+bar and am using a solarized dark color scheme in all of
them (plus st and vim), while with qtile I use kitty and in both one
colorscheme called snazzy, which I also quite like.

Programs modified:
+ ```QTile```
+ ```Vim```
+ ```dmenu```
+ ```Kitty```
+ ```bspwm```
+ ```sxhkd```
+ ```st```
+ ```polybar```
+ ```dwm```
+ That's it for now

I asume you have all of the programs I use installed, apart from
```vim-plug```, ```oh-my-zsh```, ```RobotoMono Nerd Font```, and anything I have autorun on my xinit.
